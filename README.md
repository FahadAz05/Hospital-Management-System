# Hospital Management System

## Overview

The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a C++ application designed to efficiently manage hospital operations and patient data. This system leverages advanced data structures, specifically trees, to ensure optimal performance and data organization. 

## Features

- **Patient Management**: 
  - Add, update, and remove patient records.
  - Search for patient details using patient IDs.

- **Doctor Management**: 
  - Manage doctor profiles, including scheduling and specialty information.
  - Assign doctors to patients based on specialty.

- **Appointment Scheduling**:
  - Schedule, update, and cancel patient appointments.
  - Track appointment history and upcoming schedules.

- **Medical Records**:
  - Store and retrieve detailed medical records for each patient.
  - Maintain a history of diagnoses, treatments, and prescriptions.

## Data Structures

The HMS primarily utilizes tree-based data structures for efficient data management:

- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: Used for maintaining patient and doctor records, allowing for fast search, insertion, and deletion operations.
- **AVL Trees**: An extension of BSTs, providing balanced tree operations for optimized performance.
- **Red-Black Trees**: Ensuring balanced tree structures with efficient insertion and deletion operations, used for various data management tasks within the system.
